# AI-based assistant example with RASA

This notebook describes how to create a simple yet intelligent assistant using the open-source tool RASA.

This material was presented internally at a Daitan University session, with more content including the state of the technology, caveats and limitations including scalability, etc. However, the notebook alone still gives a good idea on how to implement your own chatbot with RASA.
